## üåü Project Overview

This repository hosts an end-to-end **Human Resources Analytics Dashboard**, a powerful business intelligence tool developed in **Microsoft Power BI**. The project's core objective is to transform raw, complex employee datasets into an interactive, intuitive, and visually compelling dashboard. This solution empowers HR departments and executive leadership to move beyond guesswork, enabling them to make critical, data-driven decisions regarding talent management, compensation, and organizational structure.

The dashboard provides a 360-degree view of the company's workforce, uncovering actionable insights from key metrics and trends.

## üõ†Ô∏è The ETL Powerhouse: Data Transformation with Power Query

The foundation of any great dashboard is pristine data. The raw dataset was subjected to a rigorous ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process within the **Power Query Editor** to ensure absolute data integrity and usability.

#### The Transformation Pipeline:
1.  **Schema Correction:** Assigned precise data types (`Date`, `Fixed Decimal`, `Whole Number`, `%`) to all columns, enabling accurate calculations and time-intelligence functions.
2.  **Data Cleansing:** Proactively removed blank rows and eliminated duplicate records based on the unique `Employee ID` to prevent data skew.
3.  **Text & String Manipulation:** Split `Full Name` into `First Name` and `Last Name` for granular analysis and applied formatting standards (e.g., `UPPERCASE` for categorical data).
4.  **Feature Engineering:**
    -   **Created Age Groups (Bins):** Grouped employees into logical 10-year age brackets, transforming a continuous variable into a categorical one for powerful demographic analysis.
    -   **Extracted Time Intelligence Data:** Utilized the `Hire Date` to build a robust date table for trend analysis over years, quarters, and months.
5.  **Structural Modifications:** Strategically removed irrelevant columns (`Exit Date`) to streamline the data model and focus the analysis on the current workforce.
